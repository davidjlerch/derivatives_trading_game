# Derivatives Trading Game
This project is a simulator of a stock and derivatives market, allowing users to experience the dynamics of trading stocks and options within a simulated financial environment. The simulation includes price fluctuations of assets over time, player interactions through buying and selling stocks, as well as trading options (calls and puts).

How to interact with the market:
