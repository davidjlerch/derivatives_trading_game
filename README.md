# Derivatives Trading Game
This project is a simulator of a stock and derivatives market, allowing users to experience the dynamics of trading stocks and options within a simulated financial environment. The simulation includes price fluctuations of assets over time, player interactions through buying and selling stocks, as well as trading options (calls and puts).
